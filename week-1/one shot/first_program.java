// ii) static - indicates that the method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
// iii) void - specifies that the method doesn't return any value.
// iv) main - the name of the method
// v) string[] args - the method accepts an array of strings as perimeters. this is where command-line arguments can be passed to your program.
